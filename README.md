5. getQuoteIdByLocation() - must return null, if quoteId is not exist in location
6. getCurrentQuoteByLocation() - must return quote from store, if quote with id from location is exist
7. getCurrentQuoteByLocation() - must return null, if quoteId from location is not exist or invalid
8. getCurrentQuoteByLocation() - must return null, if quote with id from location is not exist
